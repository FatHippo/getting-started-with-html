  <h1>Important Basic Concepts</h1>
  <br>
  <h2><b>The Web</b></h2>
  <p>The web is made up of mainly HTML documents. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp">HTML</a> stands for
  <i><b>Hyper Link Markup Language</b></i>. The web contains anything,
  like pictures, <img src="http://www.jeremynoeljohnson.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/crazy_cat_3.jpg", alt="Cat", height="50">
  videos, music, or text. Browsers send requests using protocals, called HTTP, to servers which respond with files that your
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a> displays.
  </p>
  <h2><b>HTML Intro</b></h2>
  <p>
    HTML is made up of:<br>Text Content-<i>What you see</i>
    <br> Markup-<em>What it looks like</em>
    <br> References to other documents-<em>E.g. videos, images</em>
    <h1>Tags</h1>
    <h3>What are tags?</h3><p>
      HTML Markup is made up of tags. Tags are structure by starting with a less
      than symbol &#60, and then the tag name, finishing with a greater than symbol
      &#62. Then you put the contents. After the contents put another &#60 followed by a /, then the tag name and ending
      with a &#62. A visual example would be: &#60b&#62
      <b>This is what the text would look like</b> &#60/b> or &#60tagname>
      contents&#60/tagname>.
    </p>
  </p>
  <h3>Some useful tags are:</h3><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_b.asp"><b>&#60b></b></a> or <strong>&#60strong></strong> which bolds something<br>
  <em>&#60em> or &#60i></em> which italicizes something
  <br>&#60img src="<b>URL</b>", alt="<b>TEXT</b>", width="<b>NUMBER</b>", height="<b>NUMBER</b>"><br>
  <h1>Attributes</h1>
  <h3>What are attributes?</h3>
  <p>Attributes have the format of: &#60TAG ATTR="value">contents&#60/TAG></p>
  <h3>Some useful attributes are:</h3>
  <p>&#60a href="URL">What is a URL?&#60/a> which sends you to the url when clicking on the words: "What is a URL?"
    <br> For Example I inserted a website URL into the "URL" spot: <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/adnz">What is a URL?</a>
